Hey there! Welcome to my little spot on the web.

I'm Mabel — a developer, student, and occasional over-thinker. This blog is where I write about things I'm learning, building, and thinking about. Expect a mix of:

- **Technical deep-dives** — walkthroughs and notes from projects I'm working on
- **Learning logs** — honest reflections on picking up new tools and concepts
- **Random thoughts** — because not everything has to be a tutorial

## Why a blog?

Writing is how I think. When I can explain something clearly in words, I know I actually understand it. This site is part personal notebook, part accountability mechanism.

If something here is useful or wrong (both happen), I'd love to hear about it.

## What I'm currently working on

Right now I'm deep into data science coursework and building side projects with Python and JavaScript. I'm also getting comfortable with Astro for this site — turns out it's a joy to work with.

Stay tuned. There's more coming.
